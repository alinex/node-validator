# Number Schema

Create a schema that matches any data type.

This is an universal type which may be used everywhere there no further knowledge
of the structure is known. It can also be used to make a loose checking schema
first and later replace it through detailed specifications.

See at [Any Schema](any.md) for the inherited methods you may call like:
- `required`
- `default()`
- `stripEmpty`
- `allow()`
- `allowAll()`
- `allowToClear`
